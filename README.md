**Abstract:**   
BACKGROUND: The zinc homeostasis system in Escherichia coli is one of the most
intensively studied prokaryotic zinc homeostasis systems. Its underlying
regulatory machine consists of repression on zinc influx through ZnuABC by Zur
(Zn2+ uptake regulator) and activation on zinc efflux via ZntA by ZntR (a
zinc-responsive regulator). Although these transcriptional regulations seem to
be well characterized, and there is an abundance of detailed in vitro
experimental data available, as yet there is no mathematical model to help
interpret these data. To our knowledge, the work described here is the first
attempt to use a mathematical model to simulate these regulatory relations and
to help explain the in vitro experimental data. RESULTS: We develop a unified
mathematical model consisting of 14 reactions to simulate the in vitro
transcriptional response of the zinc homeostasis system in E. coli. Firstly,
we simulate the in vitro Zur-DNA interaction by using two of these reactions,
which are expressed as 4 ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By imposing
the conservation restraints and solving the relevant steady state equations,
we find that the simulated sigmoidal curve matches the corresponding
experimental data. Secondly, by numerically solving the ODEs for simulating
the Zur and ZntR run-off transcription experiments, and depicting the
simulated concentrations of zntA and znuC transcripts as a function of free
zinc concentration, we find that the simulated curves fit the corresponding in
vitro experimental data. Moreover, we also perform simulations, after taking
into consideration the competitive effects of ZntR with the zinc buffer, and
depict the simulated concentration of zntA transcripts as a function of the
total ZntR concentration, both in the presence and absence of Zn(II). The
obtained simulation results are in general agreement with the corresponding
experimental data. CONCLUSION: Simulation results show that our model can
quantitatively reproduce the results of several of the in vitro experiments
conducted by Outten CE and her colleagues. Our model provides a detailed
insight into the dynamics of the regulatory system and also provides a general
framework for simulating in vitro metal-binding and transcription experiments
and interpreting the relevant experimental data.
